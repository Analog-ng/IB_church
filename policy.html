                <p class="text-justify" style="padding: top 2%;">Our place at the forefront of digital ministry has always been driven by our passion to see technology leveraged to help people find hope, peace, and joy in the incomparable love of Christ. The LCC websites are tools we offer to serve our attenders and visitors by connecting them to one another and equipping them on their journey to becoming fully devoted followers of Christ.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify" style="padding: top 2%;">Every digital product and service we provide is created with great care and intentionality. Each one designed to help more people pursue a deeper relationship with God in a safe and secure manner. We craft these tools as an act of ministry to serve you, and you have choices in your experience. You choose what you access. You choose what you share, and with whom. Your data is yours. LCC does not sell your information, nor will we share it with others without your consent.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify" style="padding: top 2%;">And every aspect of LCC’s digital tools are completely free, with no strings attached and no advertising. Our intent is to remove every possible barrier so you’re able to focus on getting to know God more intimately.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify" style="padding: top 2%;">To make this document easier to read, we’re going to use some shorthand throughout. For example, when we say “our sites” or “LCC sites” (whether we reference them individually or collectively) we’re talking about the websites and applications offered by LCC) together with their subdomains and content. These are owned and operated by LCC Ministries, together with its parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries, which we’ll refer to as “LCC,” “us,” or “we” throughout this policy. When we refer to persons interacting with LCC in this policy, we’ll use the term “you.”</p>

                <p class="text-justify" style="padding: top 2%;">We collect personal data from you when you provide it to us both offline and online. You do not need to provide personal information to us to use the LCC sites; however, we allow you to create a profile which allows us to tailor our sites and services to be a more personalized experience. To create a profile, we require your first and last name, your email address and a password to authenticate you when you try to access your profile. Beyond the personal information needed to create a profile, you have choices about what additional information you provide to us, which may include your zip code, the names of your family members, gender, and your marital status, all of which will be stored in association with your profile. Certain information may be required based on your specific request, such as your social security number for employment inquiries and volunteer requests; we will notify you of this at the time of such a request. We also collect information about you when you send, receive, or engage in communications with us, including when you submit personal information or requests by emailing info@rgclibertychristiancentre.org We retain those communications to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our sites and our services.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify" style="padding: top 2%;">If you have a profile with us, the information you provide us is generally associated with your profile and is stored internally in our third-party relationship management system or databases. We will use this information to authenticate you and allow you to access your specific profile. We create user profiles for off-line purposes as well, which include volunteerism and inquiries concerning employment. We may combine the information you provide us for your profile and interactions with our sites with information you provide us through other LCC sites, services and products and inferences we make from the same for our internal development to improve the overall quality of our sites, services and products. We may also make recommendations to you for other LCC services based on the information you provide and we infer.

                <p class="text-justify" style="padding: top 2%;">Our LCC sites have a wide array of functionality, including streaming video, creating prayer requests, and identifying and communicating with your LCC groups and teams. Some LCC sites may allow you to publish, distribute and display certain content, which we will refer to as “posted” and the content as “posts.” Posts may be made on public areas of websites and social media accounts you access through our sites or may otherwise be transmitted to third parties. Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information in a public manner whether through collaborative postings, social media, message boards, or other public online forums, this information may be collected and used by others. We cannot control the actions of other users or third parties with whom you choose to share your posts. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your posts will not be viewed by unauthorized persons, nor do we accept any liability associated with your posts.

                <p class="text-justify" style="padding: top 2%;">If you choose to provide a voluntary donation through those LCC sites where you are able to make a donation, then and only then will you be prompted and required to provide credit card, bank account, and other payment information necessary to process the transaction. We will collect the designation for your donation, if you provide one, the LCC campus designated for your donation (if any), and personal information such as your name, address, phone number and/or email address to ensure that your donation is used for the purpose you request and to provide you with a “Annual Giving Statement” that itemizes your donation(s) for tax purposes or your personal use. This information (with the exception of your financial information) is stored in connection with your profile if you have created one for another purpose; or, if you have no preexisting profile with us, we will use this information to create a profile for you in our internal CRM system. We will not store or otherwise process financial information provided to us online for the purposes of making a donation. As of the date of this Policy, we use MPESA and PayPal to process your online donation payments. For information on how these third parties process your information, please refer to their privacy policies which may be found here: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full</a> .

                <p class="text-justify" style="padding: top 2%;">You may apply to be a volunteer for miscellaneous activities and events in person at a LCC campus, over the phone and through one or more of our sites. You may also apply for employment in person and through our sites. The information we require for volunteer and employment applications are your first and last name, telephone number, address, date of birth and, in the case of a job inquiry, your employment history. We will use this information to create a profile or associate it with your profile if one exists. We will use your social security number and date of birth solely for a background check in connection with your application to be a volunteer and/or employee, and will not share either with any other party except for third party service providers that enable us to perform background checks which are obligated not to share your information or use it for any other purpose. If you become an employee of LCC, your personal information is also used in connection with your employment.
                </p>    
                <p class="text-justify" style="padding: top 2%;">As a ministry volunteer, you may have access to third-party software which allows you to schedule and check-in to your volunteer activity, as well as manage other volunteer activity. This location-based information is stored in association with your profile to enable you to see your past volunteerism, and we also use it for our own internal analysis of volunteerism.

We also get information about your IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, and/or ISP or your mobile carrier.

                <p class="text-justify" style="padding: top 2%;">Some of our sites use GPS information to identify when you are near one of our physical locations. You will be given the opportunity to provide consent for us to use this information when you first download or begin to use our sites. If you provide that consent, we use that information to enable push notifications related to interactions with our LCC sites and physical locations. You also have the ability to manually initiate a GPS location search to identify whether you are at one of our physical locations. When using certain LCC sites, you can provide us with your GPS location through your browser, zip code, or city, which will be processed by a third-party search engine. We do not store this information outside of your device. Once your particular session of use of the feature ends, we will cease to have access to your GPS location unless you use the feature again. After your first use of this functionality and consent for us to use your GPS location, we will assume we have that consent unless you revoke it through the settings of your mobile device.
                </p>    
                <p class="text-justify" style="padding: top 2%;">We also collect and use the wireless (or “WiFi”) permissions of your mobile device to determine if you are connected to a WiFi or cellular network. This information is used to provide an optimized user experience by providing higher resolution content to a user who is on a high-speed WiFi connection rather than a cellular network. WiFi permissions are also used for casting content with Chromecast and similar devices. This information is not shared by LCC.
